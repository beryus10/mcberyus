# Booking Page Redesign TODO

## Tasks to Complete

- [x] Update booking.html: Add icons to form fields for better UX, improve section grouping with better divs/cards, and enhance overall layout structure for improved flow.
- [x] Redesign booking.css: Introduce a more sophisticated color palette (e.g., deeper golds and blacks), add subtle animations (fade-ins, smooth transitions), improve shadows and gradients, and refine responsive breakpoints for smoother device transitions.
- [x] Enhance booking.js: Add a loading spinner during form submission, improve validation feedback (highlight invalid fields), and ensure better error handling in the UI.
- [ ] Test the redesigned page locally to ensure functionality and responsiveness.
- [ ] Verify form submission works correctly with Telegram and EmailJS.
